# Gitlet

The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:

1. Saving the contents of entire directories of files.

2. Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits.

3. Viewing the history of your backups.

4. Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.

5. Merging changes made in one branch into another.
